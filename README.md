# Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio available at [c1moore.codes](https://c1moore.codes).  At the moment, the project is pretty bare-bones, but it is functional and looks good.  Goals for the future will be to make this repo more versatile by making more like a framework that others can easily clone and modify without deleting my personal information.  This repo is also in need of tests.  I built it in under 2 days to get something up instead of simply rerouting visitors to my LinkedIn profile.

## Want to Use this for Your Own E-Portfolio?

Awesome!  Just fork the project, remove my personal data, and begin personalizing it.  I only ask that you do the following:

 - Credit me on your site by linking to either my website ([c1moore.codes](https://c1moore.codes)) or to this GitHub page.  There is already a component (in `src/components/credit`) that takes care of this requirement, just make sure to display this somewhere on your website.
 - Let me know you used it!  It's always exciting to hear that somebody else found my work useful.  You can do that by using my contact info available here, on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/c1moore), or with my [contact form](https://c1moore.codes/contact).

## Roadmap

- Add tests
- Remove personal information and create a separate repo for my personalized version of this repo
- ? (Suggestions welcome)
